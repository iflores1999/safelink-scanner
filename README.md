# 🛡️ SafeLink Scanner  

**A simple cybersecurity tool that analyzes URLs and detects phishing signs.  
Built by Isela Flores as a beginner-friendly cybersecurity practice project.**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects common phishing patterns in URLs  
- Scores URL risk from **Low**, **Medium**, to **High**  
- Shows clear reasons why a URL looks suspicious  
- Clean, polished UI with light purple accents  
- Built using **Flask (Python)** + HTML/CSS  

---

## 🧠 How it works
The scanner checks URLs for things like:

- 🏷️ Suspicious words (login, verify, update, account)  
- 🔒 Missing HTTPS  
- 🧪 IP address instead of domain  
- 🌀 `@` symbol tricks that hide the real destination  
- 🧩 Many subdomains or dots  
- ❌ Suspicious TLDs (.xyz, .cn, etc.)  

Each rule adds to a score, and the score maps to:

- **Low** risk  
- **Medium** risk  
- **High** risk
